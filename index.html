   My teacher assigned me a task, create a web presentation for a computer architecture course.
He offered us a template as an example, in the file named t27. There is some code and some organization of the content.
I need to replicate that code, but I want to provide a more modern look to it, using the latest HTML5 and CSS3 features.
I still need to keep some of the original structure, but I want to enhance it with better typography, layout, and responsiveness.
I want to make sure that the presentation looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
The main issue is the professor wants simple html and css code, nothing too complex despite i want to implement modern libraries like tailwind or bootstrap.

I want you to implement curs14, but in romanian. You should create a simple HTML structure with sections, headings, paragraphs, and lists as needed.
I have to go trough all the course material, in detail, and create a comprehensive presentation that covers all the important topics.

I want a clean and organized layout, with a focus on readability and user experience. I was thinking about a python script that designs future presentations based on the course material, but for now, I need to focus on creating this initial version manually.
I have to create elements that can be easily styled later on, so I will use classes and IDs appropriately and with the python script to be able to recreate similar presentations in the future using the created elements.
